# SportsDemo
Here you will find the TOP Sports Players in the world.

For this project I used MVC architecture. 

All data is handled by UITableViews.

Frameworks used:
- Alamofire
- SwiftyJSON
- SVProgressHUD
- SwiftyOnboard

For test this project you must update pods.

Open your terminal, go to the project folder and write "pod install".

Enjoy it!
